# ACEES

Named after our names in a group project, ACEES is an academic enrollment Android app created during our mobile development class.
This app was made to make enrollment more accessible and more user-friendly.

Developed with Android Studio and PHP for backend methods. PHP methods can be modified realtime on a different machine as long as it has 
connection to the database.
